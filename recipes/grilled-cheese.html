        <h2>Grilled Cheese</h2>
        <p>Grilled cheese is my go to comfort food. The texture of the grilled bread in combinaition
            with the melted cheese is hard to beat. It is also a quick and easy food to make.
            The ingredients are simple and most often on hand. I make this recipe for myself of my son at least once a week.
            I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Bread of choice, 2 pieces- lots of types of bread work here, choose your favorite.</li>
                <li>Cheese- again, lot's of choices, choose wisely.</li>
                
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Firstly, turn on the burner to warm a flat pan with enough room to fit your sandwich on to a medium heat .</li>
                <li>Now you are going to butter one side of each piece of bread evenly. </li>
                <li>Place your cheese on the top of one slice of bread. You can put as much or little cheese as you like here, I like to cover the bread in 1 to 2 layers.</li>
                <li>Place the cheese and bread butter side down onto the warm pan and put the second slice butter side up on top. </li>
                <li>Here is the hard part. You need to let the sandwich cook till the bread is golden brown.</li>
                <li>Once the bread is cooked to perfection you can carefully flip the sandwich to the other side.</li>
                <li>Again you are going to wait till the bread is a golden brown color.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Thats it! You are done and your sandwich is reaady to eat</p>
